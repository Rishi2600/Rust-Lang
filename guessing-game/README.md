### Details -

1. This game is the part of the Rust book that I am following to learn rust.
2. I did this as the part of **Turbin3** first weeks assignment.

### Details about the Game - 

1. A very basic number guessing game where the player needs to run the program and then starts putting in random numbers in the terminal, when they get the number correct, the program closes itself announcing you the winner!
2. Steps - First a random numvber is generated in beteen 1 to 10, then the user is prompted to put in random numbers and based on the number being heigher or lower to that random number, the program gives hints until you get the number correct.
3. **Tech includes** - mutable vs immutable variables, random number generator, io operations, match/ compare methods, data type conversion, loop.
